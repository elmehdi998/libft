# libft
This project is an implementation of a simplified version of the C Standard Library. It includes functions for memory management, string manipulation, input/output operations, and other utility functions typically found in the standard library. The purpose of this project is to practice and understand the core concepts of C programming, such as memory allocation, pointers, and data structures.

Key Features:

Implementation of basic C library functions such as malloc, free, ft_strlen, ft_strdup, ft_strlcpy, ft_strlcat, and more.
Custom memory management functions (malloc, free, etc.) to handle dynamic memory allocation.
String manipulation functions to handle operations like concatenation, comparison, and searching.
Utility functions like isdigit, isspace, and others to handle common tasks.
This project is part of my journey to strengthen my understanding of C programming and low-level memory management.
